This script creates a Postgresql database and writes data contained in a csv file to the database. It is written to work on the localhost instance of a Postgresql database. Postgres servers contain a default database called postgres and this script assumes that the localhost server has this database.

The script also assumes that the csv file to be written to the database is in the same folder.

Here are some of the ways this script can be improved on :

    Ingesting data in chunks, this is more suitable for cases where there is a lot of data to be ingested.

    Adding the capability to use different data sources and numerous databases.

    Addition of command line arguments for running the script, for example, a user might need to specify the location for a csv file.


There are different ways to achieve automation using the script depending on a given environment:

    On Windows, you can use the Task Scheduler to run the script whenever the CSV file is modified.

    In a cloud setup, the script can be set up to run using a lambda function.

The above solutions would require modification of the script to suite the  environment in which it is used.
